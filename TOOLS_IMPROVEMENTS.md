# Music Tools Improvements

## Date: October 27, 2025

### üé∏ Guitar Tuner Enhancements

#### Improved Audio Processing
- **Increased FFT Size**: Changed from 8192 to 16384 samples for better low-frequency detection (essential for bass strings)
- **Better Sample Rate**: Explicitly set to 44100 Hz for consistent audio processing
- **Improved Smoothing**: Adjusted smoothing constant from 0.3 to 0.4 for more stable readings

#### Enhanced Pitch Detection Algorithm
- **Stronger Signal Requirements**: Increased RMS threshold from 0.01 to 0.015 to filter out noise
- **Better Center Detection**: Improved threshold from 0.2 to 0.15 for more accurate waveform centering
- **Buffer Validation**: Added minimum buffer size check (100 samples) to prevent false readings
- **Confidence Check**: Added maxval validation (> 0.1) to ensure reliable pitch detection
- **Frequency Filtering**: Added explicit frequency range filter (40-2000 Hz) to eliminate outliers

#### Parabolic Interpolation
- Enhanced sub-sample accuracy for precise cent calculations
- Better boundary checking to prevent errors at buffer edges

### ü•Å Metronome Sound Improvements

#### Realistic Mechanical Click
The metronome now sounds like a real mechanical metronome with:
- **Dual-Oscillator Design**:
  - High-frequency oscillator (2000 Hz, square wave) for the "tick" sound
  - Low-frequency oscillator (100 Hz, sine wave) for the mechanical "thump"
- **Authentic Envelope**:
  - Quick attack with exponential decay
  - Short durations (30ms for click, 50ms for thump)
- **Balanced Volume**: Carefully tuned gain levels for realistic sound

### üìù Technical Improvements

#### Code Quality
- Better error handling and validation
- Improved audio context cleanup
- More robust signal processing
- Enhanced noise rejection

#### Performance
- Optimized autocorrelation algorithm
- Better memory management
- Efficient audio context cleanup after sounds

### üéØ Usage

#### Guitar Tuner
1. Click "Start Tuner" to allow microphone access
2. Play a note on your guitar
3. The LCD display shows the note name and tuning deviation
4. The needle shows how many cents sharp (+) or flat (-) you are
5. Aim for the needle at 0¬∞ (center) for perfect tuning

#### Metronome
1. Adjust BPM using the slider (60-200 BPM)
2. Click "Start" to begin the metronome
3. Use "Tap Tempo" to set BPM by tapping the button in rhythm
4. Visual indicator flashes with each beat

### üîÑ Cache Updates
- Service Worker: v1.7.1
- CSS Version: v20251027g
- All pages updated for cache-busting

### üéµ Next Steps
Consider adding:
- Visual tuning indicator colors (red/yellow/green)
- Different metronome sounds (wood block, hi-hat, etc.)
- Beat subdivision options (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 notes)
- Time signature selection (3/4, 4/4, 6/8, etc.)
- Accent on first beat for better timing practice
